\## Retail Sales Performance Dashboard ##

A comprehensive retail analytics solution that helps retail managers understand sales performance, profitability, and growth patterns across multiple dimensions. This project transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards and automated data processing.



\# Business Problem

Retail managers need to understand:

\- Sales Performance: Track total sales, profit margins, and year-over-year growth

\- Geographic Insights: Identify high-performing regions, states, and cities

\- Product Analysis: Discover top/bottom performers by category and sub-category

\- Customer Behavior: Analyze average order value and return patterns

\- Operational Efficiency: Monitor return rates and their impact on profitability



No more spreadsheet headaches – get clear, visual insights that drive better business decisions.
